            <h2>The College Emblem</h2>
            <p>
                Crowning the emblem is the line “Tamso Ma JyotirGamaya” which is the part of a three-line Vedic
                Incantation.
                This has been taken from the Brahadaranyaka Upanishad which forms an intrinsic part of the Yajur Veda.
                It is
                a prayer to our supreme creator to enlighten and illumine our minds thereby blessing us with the power
                to
                distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just as the Sun enables an evolution from a world of darkness to light, similarly the Light House shown
                in
                the emblem depicts how the power of education leads us from a state of avidya to vidya or from ignorance
                to
                knowledge. The burgeoning magnificence of the Light House, the stellar brightness of the rays reaching
                afar
                further underscores the transforming potential of quality education.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our College endeavors to strike a perfect poise between antiquity and contemporaneity, convention, and
                modernity. Our enterprise is to create an amalgam of tradition and technology. We strive to disseminate
                education in consonance with upcoming trends, global challenges, and topical necessities never losing
                sight
                of truth, correct knowledge, and righteousness. Education for us is a never-ending process of reaching
                out,
                illuminating the deepest niche in the minds of the youth of today. Like the magnificent rays of Light,
                education for us symbolizes an undying quest for knowledge towards the pursuit of excellence.
